# axis-labels-customization-flutter-cartesian-chart

The Flutter Cartesian Chart widget provides support for customizing the axis labels in the chart using the callback events on rendering. A callback event is a callback function or method, which you pass as an argument in another function or method and can perform an action when you require it. Likewise, the chart widget provides a callback event called axisLabelFormatter to customize the axis labels as required.
